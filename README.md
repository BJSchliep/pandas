# Overview

This dataset is a representation of Software developer salaries in the US. Information included is the city, the average salary of the software developer, average salary with cost of living calculated into the total, rent, median home prices, and number of jobs in the cities.

I had questions with this data. I wanted to know the top 10 salaries along with the names of the city and I wanted to know the cities with the least amount of jobs available. Then, to compare the average salary, median home price, and number of jobs according to the cities.
